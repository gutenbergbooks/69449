<p class='c006'>“As for my particular, I am
verily perswaded, that since that
age (thirtie yeares), both my
spirit and my body have more
decreased than encreased, more
recoyled than advanced. It may
be that knowledge and experience
shall encrease in them,
together with life, that bestow
their time well: but vivacitie,
promptitude, constancie, and
other parts much more our owne,
more important, and more essentiall,
they droope, they languish,
and they faint.”—<span class='sc'>Montaigne</span>

The ending of the
nineteenth century,
like that of
the eighteenth,
was a time of terrible and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>strange things, as if it were
coming to be the law of
human affairs that the sunsets
of the centuries should
be red with a “Terror”
and dark with despair.</p>

<p class='c008'>In England—then, as in
the past, the refuge of banished
men—social disorder
reached a height that
would soon have driven all
her quiet dwellers to seek
more peaceful homes on
the other side of the globe,
had not a new and strange
thing changed the whole
aspect of affairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>It began to be perceived,
and was soon widely acknowledged,
that the cause
of the great weakness and
futility of our government
lay in the advanced age of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>those by whom the most
important offices were held.
Age is wont to trifle, to
take things lightly, and to
study life, of which it can
at best hope to possess so
little, from a frivolous and
temporary point of view.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Things are well enough
as they are,” say they; “a
little tinkering here, a little
fancy legislation there, and
they will last our time;
meanwhile, let us hear ourselves
talk.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The only wonder now
seemed that the world had
been so slow to perceive
this, that it had taken the
human race so many thousand
years to discover a
truth which now seemed as
simple and patent as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>converse one, that it would
not be wise to entrust grave
affairs to children in their
first decade.</p>

<p class='c008'>And so the younger men
of England, by a sudden
and united effort at the
general election of 19—, secured
the return of a House
of Commons containing no
man over the age of thirty-five,
and no woman: (for
women had begun to come
in and to make matters
worse).</p>

<p class='c008'>This House of Commons,
strong, in earnest for
real work, and not divided
by Party, that frivolous
pastime of politicians who
were too old for other
games, passed without difficulty
a wise “superannuation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>law.” And the government
of the country, thus
at last able to govern indeed,
made the almost
foundering ship of our unhappy
State once more answer
to the helm, and
steered for that haven of
peaceful order and settled
rule which men remembered
sadly as a lost Paradise
or longed for as
an undiscoverable “Atlantis.”</p>

<p class='c008'>That <i>laws are made to be
obeyed</i> had glided in those
days from the place of a
truism into that of a fallacy.
It was the first principle
of the new Cabinet.</p>

<p class='c008'>To two classes this principle
had to be made clear—Criminals,
or law-breakers;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Anarchists, or law-deniers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of the first of these we
will speak first. It will now
hardly be believed that
there existed at that time in
England what were called
“the Criminal Classes”—thousands
of men, women,
and children known to be
living in the continual commission
of crime, as other
people are engaged in commerce,
husbandry, and the
like, spending much of
their time in prison, and
never doing or desiring any
honest work.</p>

<p class='c008'>This state of things the
young government set
themselves to bring to an
end.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead of progressing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>towards that universal slipshod
leniency which the
philanthropists of an earlier
time had set before themselves
as a goal—with capital
punishment evaded for
awhile and eventually abolished,—these
rulers, with
all the ruthless severity of
youth, extended the area
of crimes punishable by
death. To those whose
lives were hurtful to the innocent
community, mercy
could only be shown, so they
held, at the expense of those
to whom mercy, that is, protection,
was really due.
Not only all who compassed,
or even attempted
the lives of others, but all
who after repeated smaller
punishments still lived the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>lives of evildoers, were
counted unworthy longer
to live,—and this without
any attempted distinction
of sane or insane,—the existence
of the latter being
considered even more hopelessly
injurious to the State
than that of the former,
and, on the other hand, less
valuable to themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>But while the punishment
of death was certain
and frequent, it was no
longer inflicted in the barbarous
manner which continued,
a ghastly anachronism,
through the reign of
the tender-hearted Victoria.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those whose lives were
forfeit were placed for a
time—the length of which
depended on various circumstances—in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>a place of
solemn sequestration, to
the care of which a society
of holy men and women
devoted their existence,
and which was placed
rather under the authority
of the Church than of the
State. The State, indeed,
had done with them; they
were already cut off from
their place as citizens; it
only remained for the
Church to lead them with
kind hand through paths of
penitence and prayer to the
door of a new life, a new
hope—where this was possible.
With some, with
many perhaps, the soul
seemed already dead before
the body.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the time came, surrounded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>by a serious company
of the “Brethren of
Death,” whose prayers and
solemn hymns made the
last moments beautiful to
those who were repentant,
and awful to those who
were hardened, the condemned
drank an opiate,
which closed their eyes in
a painless sleep from which
there was no waking, while
those about them still
prayed for the departing
spirit on its way to a higher
judgment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Beautiful histories were
told of some who in the
quiet of their cells, aided
by the gentle ministrations
of the Brothers and Sisters,
came to see with an anguish
of repentance the sinfulness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>of their past, and to rejoice
in the thought of passing,
sprinkled with fresh dews
of penitence and forgiveness,
away from a world
whose temptations had been
too strong for them. Of
their forfeit lives they made
a willing sacrifice, and they
were glad to be allowed to
lay them down.</p>

<p class='c008'>Children who had committed
crimes, after fitting
punishment were placed in
settlements where they were
kept under strict discipline
and carefully instructed,
the rudiments of some useful
art being added to a
simple education in general
subjects. Girls were trained
in household work, and all,
as soon as they were grown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>men and women, were removed
from these settlements
to places where their
past was unknown, unless
they showed themselves so
dyed with their early habits
and so resolved to return
to them that this would
have been harmful to the
State.</p>

<p class='c008'>In these cases, which
were very few, they were
treated in the same way as
the hardened offenders
of whom I have just
spoken.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were not wanting
intelligent persons to whom
the punishment of death
for a misused life seemed a
terrible and even a wicked
thing. Yet, not only had
such punishment been in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>use for just such offences in
the time of Queen Elizabeth
and of other sovereigns, but
at so late a time as the commencement
of the present
century, war among civilized
nations was considered
justifiable, and the profession
of a soldier was even
held to be a noble and
Christian calling. The very
women whose tender hearts
cried out against the new
law would send their young
sons away with their blessing
to face death in compassing
that of other innocent
and unwilling victims
in a cause for which, often,
none of them cared. Those
who thus perished in war,
believing that it was for
their country’s honour that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>they fought, were among
the best and bravest of the
nation—men to whom discipline
and order were their
very breath. Those whom
the new law excluded from
life were scarcely worthy
of the name of men, and
more hostile to their country
than any of the soldiers of
other states.</p>

<p class='c008'>This then was the course
adopted with reference to
the Law-Breakers. We must
now speak of the Law-Deniers.
Anarchy, Socialism,
free-land leagues, communistic
democracy more or
less indigenous, and every
shade of Nihilism and Dynamitism
introduced from the
East and the West, had so
long had free course that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>a large mass of the population
had come to believe
practically that might was
right, and the problems of
the earliest stages of barbarism
were staring men in
the face as the products of
an over-ripe civilization.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was true, and the young
rulers recognized this, that
much of the discontent of
the poorer classes had had
just ground in the indifference
and selfish luxury of
the rich, but that cause
was already in great part
removed, and in two
ways.</p>

<p class='c008'>Women as highly educated
as men, and now wise
enough to see that they
were made for better things
than the dust of politics,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>turned their thoughts to
home reforms. Their
higher standard of principle
and refinement of taste led
to a contempt for what was
gorgeous or costly in dress
or equipage, food or furniture,
as essentially vulgar,
or at best barbaric. Thus
their quiet ways and simple
attire left little space to be
bridged over as regards outward
show between them
and the thrifty women of a
humbler class, and that
space was bridged by kindly
intercourse, by knowledge
shared, and by the
ready sympathy which is
the gift of the highest intelligence.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was one great power
for good. The other was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>the fact that so many
owners of land had devoted
large portions of it to sites
for Industrial Villages, and
even those who had no sympathy
for the poor or enthusiasm
for the good of their
country, partly for fashion’s
sake, and partly because
these schemes proved not
only useful to the poor but
beneficial to the landowner,
joined to aid the great work
of withdrawing the population
from the towns into
the country.</p>

<p class='c008'>The gradual disuse of
steam, with all its dismal
accompaniments of blackened
skies and unlovely
chimneys, allowed of almost
all manufactures being carried
on under healthy and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>cheerful conditions. On
every hill, rows of windmills
gathered the force
which produced electricity
and stored it for the use of
the village below; while by
every stream, and on every
shore visited by tides, the
forces of water were in the
same way brought into a service
which, being no longer
intermittent, was of permanent
and continuous value.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus the real misery of
the honest poor in England
was becoming a thing of
the past, and the large class
of people whose stock-in-trade
was the discontent of
others became at once more
reckless and more dangerous
when, flinging away all
disguise and separated from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>those whose wrongs had
lent colour to their schemes,
they appeared under their
true flag as the enemies of
all law and duty, industry
and religion.</p>

<p class='c008'>The young Cabinet saw
at once the way to meet
them. Those who would
not obey the laws of one
country must seek a home
in another. Banishment
seemed at once the mildest
and the most reasonable
punishment (if indeed it
can be so called),—not transportation
to some special
spot, but simply exile from
England and from all British
dominions and colonies—the
Great Federation
being absolutely united in
this important matter—under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>penalty of death if the
banished returned.</p>

<p class='c008'>On conviction the Anarchist
was marked, by an
indelible brand in a painless
manner, with a red O in
sign of outlawry, and received
his sentence of banishment—and
in this way
some thousands of the disaffected
and idle were at
once removed from our
shores.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of them were of
the lowest and most violent
class, who are naturally
rude and lawless because
bound by no inner law
themselves (though, as has
been shown, those leading
an actually criminal life
were dealt with in other
ways); and associated with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>them, indignant at the new
law, and therefore enthusiastically
determined to
share the fate of the exiled,
were men and women of a
far higher type, mistaken,
yet nobly in the wrong.
Some few were poets, historians,
religious visionaries,
women whose dreams
of a millennium were based
on a false notion of the
origin and essence of law.
All these last gave themselves
up at once, and
stretched out the right
hand that had held the pen,
or blessed the chalice, or
soothed the dying forehead,
for the circle in which they
gloried as a sign of their
fellowship with the oppressed.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>At first the result was, of
course, that in other countries
the Anarchists found
hearers for their doctrines
and ready adherents to
their destructive schemes,
the false notion that lawlessness
is liberty being
one readily welcomed by
the unthinking. But one
by one the countries to
which they had fled followed
the precedent of
England, and banished
from their shores also the
men and women of the
red right hand. In those
days the States of Europe
were already bound in a
sort of confederation, with
an International Court in
which matters of common
interest were discussed, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>it was agreed that a place
must be found for the
growing nation of outlaws,
who else might justly plead
for a home in a law-obeying
state as a mere necessity
of humanity.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the terrible era of volcanic
action which began
about the year 1885 and
lasted nearly half a century,
many coasts and islands
had been submerged, with
great loss of human life
and of the results of human
industry. Among others
the beautiful Island of Meliora
in the South Pacific
had been the scene of the
sudden formation of a volcano
and of a fearful eruption.
It seemed as if the
whole heart of the Island
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>were poured for many
days and nights into the
sultry sky, and then sank
into the sea and was seen
no more.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a period of several
years, the captain of a merchant
vessel, looking with
his corrected chart for the
circle of coral reef which
marked the place of the
lost Island, saw with wonder
Meliora re-arisen from the
sea, crowned by the wide
crater of its fatal mountain
and already clothed with
brilliant vegetation. It
would seem strange that
its re-appearance had not
been noticed by other vessels,
as the trees upon it
showed that it must have
been some years above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>water, but this will not appear
remarkable when it is
known that no ordinary
course for vessels carried
them within sight of the
Island, and that the new
reefs which had been raised
around it by the action of
the volcano were so dangerous
that captains who
entered those seas avoided
their neighbourhood. The
line of coral reef which encircled
the Island had not
sunk more than a few feet,
hence the thick growth of
Coco-palms that covered it
had not been submerged,
and no doubt directly Meliora
arose from the waves
seeds from these would at
once begin to take root
and make rapid growth in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>that wonderful soil and climate.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the captain of the
“Ville d’Is,” driven out of
his way by adverse winds,
saw the wonder of the restored
land, it was at the
moment of perplexity of
which I have spoken as to
where the outlawed nation
should find a home.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was at once resolved
by the united governments
of Europe that they should
be offered transport to this
Island—an offer which the
most part gladly accepted,
chased as they had been
from country to country,
and very weary of their
wandering.</p>

<p class='c008'>Indeed, what other chance
remained for them, since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>to enter any civilized country,
any country governed
by settled rule of law, was
to die?</p>

<p class='c008'>From all points of the
compass ships with various
flags entered the circle of
reefs that surrounded Meliora,
and set down their
strange passengers on that
beautiful shore.</p>

<p class='c008'>A land large enough for
all, fertile as a garden of
romance, perfect in climate,
and abounding in all they
could need for food, clothing
and shelter, what more
could the outlaws desire?</p>

or out of a certain part
thereof, and during a prefixed

The first to land
in Meliora were
a company of
English Socialists,
with whom a few of
the best who so called themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>were careful to cast
in their lot. These were
men of forethought and resource,
and the truth that
the circumstances of men
are made by their inner
natures was never more
clearly seen than in the
difference which soon appeared
in the homes of the
new settlers. The leader
of this elect company was
an old Scholar who in
his younger days had distinguished
himself in many
ways, but, from a genuine
belief that the medicine of
a sick world lay in a socialist
creed, had laid aside all
that had gained him fame
and credit for this one
dream, and sealed his
choice with the brand.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>To him in his old age,
after years of desolate wanderings,
the thought of a
home in a new Atlantis
was welcome indeed,—the
soft sweet air of the southern
seas, the beautiful vegetation
and strange fantastic
story of the Island awakened
the old poetic feelings of
his youth, and it seemed
as if his mission to the
world would here meet fulfilment
and find its lost
harmony with the earlier
longings of his genius and
fancy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Through his help and
counsel the first settlement
of the land was organized,
houses suitable to the climate
were built, Indian
corn and other crops for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>which they had brought a
common stock of seed were
sown for the coming season,
and to each was allotted an
equal share of the fruitful
land on which there was
only so much need to
labour as Adam found in
Milton’s Paradise.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of course were more
industrious, some more ingenious,
than others. Some
had less bodily vigour; among
these were those of
whom I have spoken as the
elect few—the old Scholar
and a little company of
young clerics, “Priests” of
the Church of England.</p>

<p class='c008'>This Church from the
time of its disestablishment
had begun a new life—it
had at once shown its vitality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>by casting off some of
its old disused organisms
and by adapting itself in
quick sympathy to the
needs of a changed order
of things.</p>

<p class='c008'>The young Priests of
whom I have spoken believed
that men had lost
sight of the great communistic
idea of early Christianity,
and they made
themselves poor and homeless
for the sake of their
creed. True brethren of the
Cross they were, not the
less willing to cast in their
lot with the outlawed because
most of these denied
the Christian faith with
their lips. Some of them
they knew acknowledged it
in their lives, while in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>multitude who cast away
all law and chose evil rather
than good, they recognized
the lost sheep whom it was
their mission if possible to
recall.</p>

<p class='c008'>These men, who were less
strong in body than many
others, were yet much more
skilful in the use they made
of the advantages which all
shared alike, and even the
women, of whom a small
company of enthusiasts
had arrived, were so wise
and industrious in the
building of their simple
homes and the tilling of
their small plots, that the
western point of the Island,
in which these elect ones
took up their abode, became
soon a thriving and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>pleasant settlement, while
the homes of the less intelligent,
even of those who were
of great bodily strength,
were of poorer construction,
their lands worse tilled,
and an altogether different
manner of living and occupation
prevailed among
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>And this notwithstanding
that the little brotherhood
of Priests made no home
for themselves beyond a
rude shelter from the air
before they had built with
the best skill they possessed,
and with all the
help they could persuade
others to give them, a
church where daily worship
of the simplest kind was
offered.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Things went for a time
very happily; all that the
elect company possessed of
skill or knowledge they
were eager to share with
others. The old Scholar of
whom I have spoken gave
advice in regard to the
building of each new dwelling;
those whose crops
were the largest shared with
those who had least, and
through the whole little colony
in the western part of
the Island a common exile
produced a common feeling
of loyalty to one another,
and of desire for the good
of the community, to which
for a time even those who
professed to believe in no
moral order yielded. I
cannot say that the white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>wooden church among the
Bread-fruit trees held many
worshippers, but at least
the Christian Brotherhood
was looked upon as a harmless
and kindly element in
the new society.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some Russian noblemen
and students were among
the next arrivals. They
were full of enthusiasm for
the future of the settlement,
though enraged at their
banishment, and a little
jealous of the established
order they found on the
island and of the influence
of the Scholar and the
Priests. The former, by the
love and esteem in which
he was held by many, and
even by the beauty of
his venerable countenance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>seemed to them dangerously
like a patriarch or chief,
and the superiority of the
western dwellings was to
them a sign of something
reactionary. They built
their own homes rather
carelessly, and gathered
little companies together
by the side of the Lagoon
to whom they talked in low
and earnest tones and in
excellent English of the
beauty of Anarchy and of
Nihilism, glorifying the
<i>absence</i> of certain things as
a <i>presence</i> more than any
religion or philosophy had
done before. The “Nothing”
of Molinos, the
emptiness of Nirvana, would
have been far too existent
for them.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Their ideas did not always
meet with acceptance,
for even the more violent
of the Socialists could
hardly see that there was
an object for destructive
denunciations in the simple
order which seemed to
them an assurance of individual
freedom.</p>

<p class='c008'>But a change was coming.</p>

<p class='c008'>I am not going here to
write the history of the
great Irish revolution which
followed the separation of
that country from England.
It is well known how terrible
that time was, and how,
when all men were wearied
out and sick to death of
the horrors of civil war,
there followed a great swing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>of the pendulum towards
order and high-handed
government; they entreated
for a king of the Royal
Family of England, and a
strongly Conservative Cabinet
in Dublin banished in
large numbers all who remained
of the disaffected
party.</p>

<p class='c008'>These were the men who
next landed in Meliora.
They had been maddened
with rage against their own
Church in consequence of
the wise part taken by the
Pope and the Irish bishops
against the revolutionary
party. Hence they were
enemies of all creeds and
forms of religion, and they
were also of course filled
with the old bitterness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>against all of English
race.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the same time a great
number of German and
Belgian Socialists of the
most violent kind were also
landed on the Island, and
they found no difficulty in
making friends at once with
the Irish company, the
German system of education
having made them as perfect
in the use of foreign
tongues as it left them ignorant
of the first principles
of moral law and of all
sound theories of government
and political economy.</p>

<p class='c008'>These new-comers settled
themselves in the southeast
of the Island, where
there were large forests of
Coco-palms, Bananas, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Bread-fruit trees, which
they began at once to fell
in order to use the timber
for their houses, and this
in so wasteful a way that
they cut down those trees
which were valuable for
fruit, but of slight use as
timber, quite as freely as the
others. Indeed, for such
houses as they wanted much
smaller wood was sufficient.
The abundant Hybiscus
would have supplied all
their material in that climate,
where solid and substantial
dwellings are entirely
needless.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not content with a reckless
destruction in their own
district, they did not scruple
to begin cutting wood from
the coco-bearing reef which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>fringed the Lagoon far to
the westward of their settlement.</p>

<p class='c008'>A gentle remonstrance
from those whom I will
name the Western party
called forth feelings of anger
and unreason in these men
of violent ideas, and there
arose among them, it is
scarcely known how, an
idea of building ships in
which they might go out and
subdue some neighbouring
islands. At the same time
they had a scheme for constructing
defences on their
own shore against the attacks
they might in this
manner provoke. And,
later, they showed signs of
erecting a sort of stockade
which, with the abrupt line
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>of the great mountain and
its outlying ridges of broken
crater, would separate them
from the Western settlement.
At first, as has been
said, the scheme which led
to their cutting down the
forest was chiefly one for
shipbuilding. To this the
Western party strongly opposed
themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>What indeed was the use
of such a project? All the
islands of the South Pacific,
in which signs of their great
future were already foreshadowing,
were members
of the British Federation.
To land on any one of
them could only mean a defiance
of the whole power
of that Federation, some
fresh laws of repression, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>possibly the presence of
troops in the island.</p>

<p class='c008'>And this, a mean and
futile struggle with the laws
of a strong country instead
of the peaceful future for
which the Island might have
looked—a future not of conflict,
but of freedom and
peace, so the Western enthusiasts
believed—a future
in which every man should
be a law to himself, in which
each should willingly work
for all—a future from which
the old world, with its worn-out
notions, should learn
this lesson—that to be without
laws was not to be lawless,
and that freedom from
forms of external government
did not mean slavery
to selfishness and passion.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Such counsels of perfection
were hardly fitted for
the wilder notions of the
Southern and Eastern settlers.
The remonstrances
of the West were met with
many an angry cry. From
the Irish that they had not
come round the world to
submit again to English
rule; from the Russians
that they would not be
governed by priests; from
the Germans every possible
argument with no possible
ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a time a sort of
parliament was convened
in an amphitheatre formed
by one of the craters of the
great mountain. No one
could think of this strange
place of assembly as having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>been so lately given over
to the two fiercer elements
of those primal four in
which the old world believed,
the rush of angry
Fire, or the wash of stormy
Waves under which it had
lain a little while, but long
enough for the busy coral
creatures to have claimed it
for a foundation. Now it
seemed as if Earth from the
beginning had held it in
her green arms, and as if
the gentle Air had immemorially
carried to and fro
the sleepy odours of its
wonderful flowers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here they met, the Western
party standing loyally
round their leaders and chief
speakers—the old Scholar
of whom I have spoken, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>young Priests, and a large
company of English working
men, who believed
heartily in the communistic
idea. I will not say that
as they discussed the affairs
of their Island nationality
and opinion always kept
together. There were some
Englishmen of a low type
who applauded the violent
and warlike party; there
was a company of the wiser
and more educated Russians
who were convinced
by the words of the West;
there were moderate men
among the Germans and
Belgians; but the Irish were
mostly for the axe and the
sword. It was clearly shown
at this time that the Moderates
were in the minority;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>there was no force to which
they could appeal, and, as
the sun set behind the
ridge on which they stood,
they turned and went rather
sadly homeward.</p>

<p class='c008'>Still there seemed one
effort to be made. The
Western party was now,
through the opposition of
the South, bound by a real
unity of thought. They
could, at any rate, set
themselves to persuade by
individual converse some
of the other side; indeed,
as I have said, some of the
better class of Russian Nihilists
had already been
convinced—these might influence
their own people.</p>

<p class='c008'>So for a while, though
without much hope, milder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>counsels were urged here
and there by messengers
from the West, who went
singly across the hills to
speak to all who would
listen. The young Priests
even endeavoured to recall
some of the settlers of the
South to thoughts of duty
and heavenly wisdom, and
preached the gladness of a
life in which each lived for
his fellows, in contrast with
the misery of that state in
which each strove for his
own gain, wrangling like
brute beasts. But though
some few, touched by words
that recalled an innocent
past, inclined at least to
consider their meaning,
there were but few who
were ready to receive them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>and to most the Cross
seemed but a worn-out emblem
of the creed of oppressors.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finally, the sole result of
all these efforts was to
rouse the opposition of the
Southern leaders, who went
to and fro denouncing those
of the West, inflaming the
passions of their own followers
by violent appeals
and angry denunciations,
till that day came which all
had foreseen—how could it
indeed not come? Yet it
seemed, so said those who
remained to tell the story,
as if so horrible a thing
could not really happen in
that sweet, languid air, under
that warm sun, tempered
by soft winds and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>sweet with a thousand
flowers. Conflict and tumult
and cruelty—what
had they to do with such a
scene?</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a Sunday morning.
All the Western folk were
gathered in and round the
church, whose open arcaded
sides allowed those without
to join freely the worship
of those within. The church
indeed was too large for
those who mostly cared to
enter it, but to-day the sense
of coming trouble brought
the whole community together.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly upon the sound
of prayer broke in the noisy
shouts and hideous laughter
of their enemies; a wild
multitude came rushing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>through the trees, and then
forming a ring round the
church and the kneeling
crowd, they called for those
they most hated in all that
company—the Scholar and
the Priests.</p>

<p class='c008'>The old Scholar, if the
truth be told, was one who
had no love for creeds; he
cared little for churches,
though these Churchmen
he had come to honour as
men—good men, wise, gentle
and true of heart. He
took pleasure in believing
that he was no Christian,
not knowing himself. For
in truth he loved the Christ
in His poor, and in these
men His servants, and he
had long lived, though, as
has been said, not thinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>it, the life of the Cross.
Self had long been put
away, so far as it can be
by any still dwelling in the
flesh, only he had not ever
looked up into the face of
Him who led him by the
hand. He was therefore not
within the church, but a
little away, under a Bread-fruit
tree.</p>

<p class='c008'>But when he heard them
call his name, he came and
stood upon the steps at the
door and spoke to the
leaders of the crowd. He
said that they might do as
they would with him, but
he would entreat them once
again to consider what was
good for the peace and
safety of the whole Island.
He begged them to spare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>the Priests who had come
there to serve them, to
teach their children, and to
help all with wise counsels
and the example of virtuous
lives. While he spoke, these
men, having reverently
finished their prayers, came
and stood beside him. Then
the crowd broke out in
wild cries and thrust them
back into the church, while
some of their number, with
a sudden inspiration from
the Evil Will, set fire to the
slight wooden roof of the
porch.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was but for a little
while that the flames ran
round the dry, thin walls
and mounted the wooden
spire, and rose, a column
of clear, pale scarlet against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>the brilliant green
of the tall Bread-fruit
trees. Those within the
church saw that there was
no escape, and the youngest
of the Priests, a boyish fellow
who in England had
thought much about stoles
and albs, quietly gave out
the hymn they had meant
to sing at the end of the
service. All joined with
one voice, and only as the
flames wrapped round and
choked them the sound of
their singing died away—no
groan, no cry for help,
no struggle to escape, but
just one solemn, triumphant
martyr song, and all was
still. The old Scholar died
on the steps of the altar, as
they knew by his signet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>ring, an antique of great
beauty, on which was engraved
the figure of a man
bound by his outstretched
hands and feet, supposed
to represent Prometheus
chained upon the rock.</p>

Thus ended the
hopes of the
West. The time
that followed
was one of wild confusion.
Violence was the only law,
and those who escaped in
that terrible day yielded
themselves in hopeless misery
to the disorders they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>could not avert or control.
Some few there always were
who longed for order and
peace, and mourned in silence
for their lost leaders;
but none had the courage
to speak out.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was in these days that
a ship of strange appearance
was seen approaching
the entrance of the Lagoon,
which, passing quickly
round to the north of the
Island, a bare, rocky region
not yet inhabited, landed
there a large number of
passengers, and before the
rest of the inhabitants could
cross the mountain and discover
who were the new-comers,
the ship which
brought them had vanished
again into the open sea.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>A stealthy departure and
scarcely to be wondered
at, for the government
of Burmah had grave fears
whether even on the Island
of Outlaws its passengers
could be welcomed
or endured. They were a
large company of an entirely
lawless robber race known
at that time by the name of
Dacoits—the terror of the
Burmese country.</p>

<p class='c008'>These men soon found
that they had been put
ashore on the least fertile
part of the Island, and they
began to come over the
heights and plunder the
older settlers for whatever
they needed, even driving
them from their homes and
taking possession of these.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>There was no government
or settled order to
which anyone could appeal—“each
man for himself”
was the only rule. The
number of the early settlers
was much diminished by
the years of strife and violence,
and though some of
those who came as children
to the Island were now
growing to man’s and woman’s
estate, these were not
many, and the fact that
among the older settlers
there were some who had
families was a great source
of weakness to them as
against the new-comers, for
even the most lawless of
the old Southern men
dreaded the attacks of
these wild marauders upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>their feeble women and
children.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus the presence of the
Dacoits wrought a change
at once on the island.</p>

<p class='c008'>The common trouble to
which they were now exposed
inclined the earlier
settlers to look upon one
another with more friendly
eyes, and indeed I think by
this time they were all beginning
a little to weary of
conflict, and so they drew
together and determined on
measures in which they
should all unite for driving
the Dacoits back to the
North, or at any rate reducing
them to some sort
of subjection.</p>

<p class='c008'>But this was by no means
easy. Men who had no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>scruple at midnight murder,
and delighted in the torture
of little children in the sight
of their mothers, could not
be met by any force but
that of perfectly organized
and strong repression, and
the leaders of the party
who now represented the
order of the Island began to
dread whether they would
not indeed all perish at the
hands of these savage invaders.
It might be so,
but all that was best in
these men rose up to meet
the danger and to defend
their homes. They were
beginning to understand
the meaning of union, of
some sort of law, of the
sacrifice of the will of each
one to the good of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>whole, when a new thing
happened.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some Dacoits who had
just been driven back from
a plundering expedition
were men who had learnt
a few words of English, and
as they sullenly retired they
uttered terrible threats against
their opponents,
which they said they would
perform when the next moon
was round, for then ships
would come bringing their
friends, and they made signs
to show that these would
come in great numbers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here were indeed tidings
of despair for the settlers.
They met once again in the
green amphitheatre in which
they had been convened
before, and many of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>remembered sadly how
things had changed for the
worse since that day. The
presence of this terror made
them all of one accord,
though there seemed nothing
to be done. The
shipbuilding projects had
been long abandoned among
the pre-occupations
of their internal conflicts,
and the little boats in which
they crossed the Lagoon
were perfectly useless for
long voyages at this time of
year; but indeed, since all
could not leave the Island,
none of them would dream
of deserting their companions
in misery.</p>

<p class='c008'>Further, if other reason
were needed for their remaining,
all but the children
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>and quite young men and,
women bore the brand
which made life impossible
for them elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now a voice was
heard among the anxious
company to which all listened,
for most of them
knew it well. It was a
woman’s voice, the voice of
one who came among the
first settlers of the West,
drawn there not by political
sympathy or communistic
fellow-feeling with them,
but simply by the thought
that here, if anywhere,
would be sick souls to heal,
sick bodies to tend, and
women and little children
needing help and care. She
was called “Our Sister,”
and no one had learnt anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>of her family or her
history. Of those whom she
comforted in sickness or
trouble, each one felt assured
that she held the creed his
mother had taught him as
a little child; some would
have sworn she belonged
to the Church of Rome;
the Russians claimed her
as theirs; some wild Welsh
Home-Rulers were certain
that she belonged to the
Primitive Methodist Connexion;
and a company of
rough men from the English
iron districts were still
more certain that her gentle
voice was that of a Quakeress
from a secluded Yorkshire
valley.</p>

<p class='c008'>It did hot matter.</p>

<p class='c008'>She had escaped, almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>alone of the inmost circle
of the West, at the time of
the burning of the church,
by the fact that she was
that day nursing a little
child who was sick of a
fever and whose mother
had just died. Since that
time evil habits and careless
living had led to a great
spread of this terrible disease,
and the Sister had
gone from one sick bed to
another bringing medicine
and the healing of her presence,
and there were those
who said that something
miraculous lay in the touch
of her hands and the whisper
of her prayer.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was her voice that
spoke in the midst of the
people that day. She stood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>on a little mound among
the tangled growth of
scented flowers—almost amidst
of the great amphitheatre—and
in the perfect
hush of her hearers and the
stillness of the clear windless
air every syllable was
heard.</p>

<p class='c008'>She said that these troubles
had come upon them,
as they knew, through their
own folly and dissensions;
that they might now, if they
were indeed united, resist
their enemies and oblige
them to live peaceably in
their own part of the Island,
getting their supplies from
the northern reef, which was
very fruitful, and not crossing
the hills; that if, taking
warning from the weakness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>which their disorders had
brought, they would set
themselves to strengthen
some simple form of government,
they might even
yet live peaceable and happy
lives on the Island. If the
new company of Dacoits
found them thus united
and strong they might submit
to the same rule as the
others; but alas! the moon
was near the full. There
was but little time for such
measures, even if all did
their best.</p>

<p class='c008'>But there was one weapon
they had all long neglected,
the weapon of Prayer, and
she entreated them all to
kneel down around her.</p>

<p class='c008'>The wild multitude thus
taken unawares in a serious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>mood did not bethink them
of scoffing, indeed they
loved her, and that was
enough.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her sweet, piercing voice
seemed to touch the cloudless
sky as she confessed
the sins of that company
and acknowledged their
need of all things; and with
words that claimed as the
gift certain to be given by a
loving father’s hand, what
others would timidly have
asked as a doubtful favour
from a distant king, she
seemed to lay hold at once
with a strong hand on all
the infinite help hidden in
the storehouse of the Heavenly
Will.</p>

<p class='c008'>She claimed for that
company, not safety only,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>but blessings and gladness
undreamed of by any; and
when she ended, a great
“Amen” went up from all
that strange congregation.</p>

<p class='c008'>At this moment a wild
cry was heard from those
who stood on the eastern
ridge of the crater, which
commanded the sea and
the opening in the reef by
which vessels entered the
Lagoon. A ship whose
lines were but too well
known was in sight: the
Dacoits were coming.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole assembly
climbed up the sides of the
crater and on to the long
ridge of hill beyond, and
stood looking seaward.
The ship came quickly
nearer—when those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>knew the coast observed
that, instead of following
the winding channel of deep
water that leads to the
opening of the Lagoon, they
were hurrying on to a great
sunken reef to the north of
this, on which the sea, being
unusually calm, was not
breaking as it was wont to
do at most seasons.</p>

<p class='c008'>They saw a crowd of
Dacoits rush to the shore
making signs to those on
board, but it was too late.
The ship struck, and sank
at once in the fathomless
depth of water outside the
reef. The Dacoits on shore
swam across the Lagoon,
and running over the reef
again, swam towards the
sunken ship, and dived in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>the hope of saving their
friends. But during this
little space of time, the
tide, which turns there very
suddenly, brought great
waves again to break over
the sunken rocks and on
the outer edge of the reef,
and many of those who
swam out to the wreck
were drowned.</p>

<p class='c008'>Why the ship took the
wrong course no one could
ever know; perhaps, having
made the voyage before,
the captain ventured without
a pilot.</p>

<p class='c008'>To all who stood on the
mountain ridge and saw
what happened in that
short space of time, it
seemed only that their
prayer had been answered.</p>

The next day
another great
meeting was
convened.</p>

<p class='c008'>Their deliverance and
the manner of it had
wrought a great change
in many, especially in the
less educated of the community,
who experienced
at that time a <i>conversion</i>—that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>reversal of the
natural selfish state which
makes self come last
instead of first in the
thoughts of a man, and
which leads him also to
realize a Presence in the
Unseen. I mention this
because it very much
changed the nature of their
deliberations. I do not say
that these conversions
would have had a lasting
effect but for certain events
which followed.</p>

<p class='c008'>All desired a settled order
in the Island. Those
who were not truly in principle
Anarchists, but rather
Democrats, proposed some
form of social contract by
which they might “confer
all their power and strength
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>upon one man, or upon
one assembly of men, that
might reduce all their wills,
by plurality of voices, unto
one will; which is as much
as to say, to appoint one
man, or assembly of men,
to bear their Person: and
every one to owne, and
acknowledge himself to be
Author of whatsoever he
that so beareth their person
shall Act, or cause to
be acted in those things
which concerne the common
Peace and Safetie;
and therein to submit their
Wills, every one to his Will,
and their Judgments to his
Judgment. This is more
than consent or concord;
it is a real Unitie of them
all, in one and the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Person, made by covenant
of every man with every
man, in such manner, as if
every man should say to
every man, ‘I authorize
and give up my right of
governing myself to this
Man or to this assembly of
men, on this condition,
that thou give up thy right
to him and authorize all his
actions in like manner.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>These words are originally
those of Thomas
Hobbes of Malmesbury,
and these, or something
like these, were spoken on
this occasion by a young
Englishman of gentle birth
and manners, but of very
ungentle notions when first
he came to the Island. He
was not one of those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>came of their own free will,
but as a branded man,
having continued, after
many warnings, to gather
large companies of men in
the London squares, and
to exhort them to Revolution.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was now, notwithstanding,
as we have seen,
rather old-fashioned in his
ideas, and his proposal was
met by not a little opposition.
Who, it was asked, should
be the governing body?
How chosen? Who should
make, and who enforce,
the laws? All the old well-worn,
yet not worn-out difficulty
about elections, and
minorities, and oligarchies,
seemed to appear in forecast
on the Island, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>at least had never known
these evils; and the young
man, as the argument proceeded,
felt himself to have
been in the wrong.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the voice which on
this day made itself heard
with the most clearness
and decision was that of a
Russian Prince, who was
persuaded as firmly as he
had ever been that in Anarchy—absence
of all government—lay
the only true
order of society. He had
always acknowledged that
to this end certain principles
of morality recognized
by the whole community,
were necessary. He had
believed, on first coming to
the Island, that the mere
absence of outward law
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>would develop in men that
natural morality from which,
under the blight of government,
they had fallen away;
and he had opposed the
work of the Priests of the
West on the ground that
the artificial restraints of
religion are as fatal as civil
enactments to the free
growth of this natural virtue.
But he had seen what
sort of fruit was borne by
common human nature
when first left in a wild
garden. His soul had been
awakened to find that the
morality of which he had
dreamed, kindled and
made living could be no
other than the life of the
Cross.</p>

<p class='c008'>In truth, like the old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Scholar of the Western settlement,
his heart had long
been dwelling in the place
of lowly service and of
death to self, without knowing
the meaning of such a
life, or putting it into the
words of the Christian faith;
for the Christian faith that
he had been taught had
been shut up in sacred
books and disguised in sacred
images, and so hidden
from his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>But on the evening before
this convention, after
the great deliverance, he
had gone up the western
slope of the mountain and
had found the Sister sitting
in silent meditation at the
door of her house, wearied
with all the anxieties and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>events of the day, and with
the reaction that comes to
all high natures after times
of tension and excitement.
The thought of the drowned
Dacoits, of the unsettled
state of the Island, of the
wickedness that abounded,
and of her own helplessness
for good, weighed on her
sensitive spirit. She was in
Elijah’s mood when he
said, “Oh, that I now might
die!”</p>

<p class='c008'>To those who feel weary
and wanting all things, the
call is often to work and to
give; and so it was that
evening with the Sister.
They spoke together by
the door of her house till
the full moon dropped
from the height of the northern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>sky towards the western
sea; and as they talked
the things unseen seemed
the only realities. The
high hope and faith in
which the Sister had long
lived and moved were communicated
in that hour to
the seeking soul of the
Prince; his whole being
rose up to greet the new
vision of the Best; and
when he took his leave of
the teacher to whom he
owed so much, it was not to
return at once to his home
by the southern shore. He
climbed by a steep path to
the mountain top, and
there, till the moon set and
dawn came over the sea, he
communed with his own
heart and swore a solemn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>allegiance to the Master
whom he had chosen.</p>

<p class='c008'>To-day, full of hope and
confidence, he rose among
the people, and laid before
them his scheme of a Christian
Anarchy—a society of
men set free from all outward
law, set free from the
bondage of self and of evil
desires, because the willing
servants of a holy Lord.</p>

<p class='c008'>As we have seen, he was
not the first to speak in the
assembly; his old restless
desire to make his voice
heard was gone; he was
clothed with a new humility.
The cause for which
he pleaded was not his,
but that of One who hastes
not:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“Day by day,</div>
      <div class='line'>And year by year He tarrieth: little need</div>
      <div class='line'>The Lord should hasten.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It has been shown that
the people were ready in
heart for such an appeal.
There was not one voice
raised against him; each
seemed fired by a high enthusiasm
for the good of
all; each eager only that
the highest will should be
done.</p>

<p class='c008'>This will not seem strange
to those who realize the excitement
of the times just
past, and who remember
how frequent in the history
of religion has been the
sudden awakening, under
strong feeling, of large multitudes
of men. I will not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>say that this was altogether
unlike such other awakenings;
I only say that it was
more lasting in its consequences
than many such
have been.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a people in this
temper the structure of the
new Polity seemed rather
the building up of a Church
than the ordering of a Commonwealth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet it truly resembled
neither of these things.
They determined that no
written laws, no written
book of religion, no formal
creed should have a place
among them. They had
seen how law-making means
law-breaking, and they determined
that their rule of
life should be simply this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>one thing—a principle, a
passion, not a command;
just this—Love to a living
Lord, in whom they recognized
the perfection of all
that the mind of man can
conceive as holiest and
best, whom they knew to be
among them always. In all
troubles and difficulties
they stretched out hands of
prayer and proved His presence.</p>

<p class='c008'>These being their
thoughts, it was rather a
furtherance of their work
than a hindrance of it that
all the books of the Priests
had been consumed in the
burning of the church.
They did not attempt, as
they might well have done,
to reconstruct a book of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Faith from the words and
thoughts with which the
memories of the Sister
and some others were
stored.</p>

<p class='c008'>These were held all the
more precious because they
had to be told by one to
another, and told again and
again, till in the hearts of
all were embedded as shining
jewels fragments of perfect
truth and flashes of
mystical insight. Dearest
to all were the parable of
the Vine and Its branches,
the Story of the Cross, the
“Sermon on the Mount,”
and many sayings such as
these: “The letter killeth,
but the Spirit giveth life;”
“He that loveth his life
shall lose it;” many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>words of St. Paul, and
especially those which
tell of the struggle of the
soul to get free from the
only real tyranny, and the
splendid anarchy of the
slaves of Christ; many
sayings of Thomas à Kempis,
of Tauler, of Molinos,
and of Marcus Aurelius,
dear to the heart of
the Sister; many fragments
of poems and hymns such
as she loved and had learnt;
many beautiful old hymns
which some of the wives of
the German Socialists remembered
and sang. But
it would not be possible
even to hint at the chosen
words which ruled the lives
of that happy community,
every voice in which swelled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>the sweet hymn of praise
which rose at morn and
even among the Bread-fruit
groves. They did not assemble
to worship or to
sing, for they sang and worshipped
everywhere.</p>

<p class='c008'>No one called anything
his own; and each was
eager to find opportunities
of helping others with his
strength or his substance.</p>

<p class='c008'>But as to the Dacoits,
concerning them even the
Prince was led to doubt the
fitness of Anarchy. They
were not, indeed, now so
strong, or the rest of the
community so weak, that
they could not be forced to
submit to laws; but they
did not seem able to understand
the very rudiments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>of that inner law which he
saw was needful to the
peace of a country ordered
on the principles of which
we have spoken.</p>

<p class='c008'>So they were taken in
calm weather in the Lagoon
boats to a small neighbouring
island, where they
would find plenty of food,
but no large timber of which
boats might be built; and
they were left there to work
out for themselves the problem
just solved on Meliora.</p>

<p class='c008'>How long the Anarchy,
which was truly a Theocracy,
would have continued
in unbroken peace cannot
be known. It is possible
that, though the children
of the first settlers were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>passionately eager for settled
order, and enthusiastically
religious, their children
might show a return of
evil tendencies, and that
those who did not remember
the first fearful days of
strife in the Island might
wilfully have roused again
a spirit of disorder; for the
world and all the spheres
mount only in upward spirals
toward that point of
the Heavens where they
shall rest at last, and are
turning always to the same
point again, only a little
higher than before.</p>

<p class='c008'>What did happen was
this.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not long after the time
of which I have written,
the Sister having died, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>been buried at her desire
high up on the mountain,
the Prince went one evening
to sit by her grave awhile
and to gather strength
by communing with the
spirit that had first led him
into the way of gladness.</p>

<p class='c008'>It had been a sultry day,
and the breeze that was
wont to cool the Island
when the sun went down
was this day asleep; no
breath lifted the heavy air.</p>

<p class='c008'>The heart of the Prince
was mournful too; only
the hidden help which
never fails upheld him in
the vague depression which
stole over him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he heard suddenly
a strange rumbling sound in
the mountain under him;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>the earth shook, and as he
sprang to his feet he saw a
horrible sight—the sea
drawn back from the reef,
sucked from the great Lagoon,
and then rushing in
upon the Island and surging
up over the reef, over the
fringe of Palms, over all the
peaceful homes below.
Twice this was repeated as
he staggered down from the
highest point of the mountain;
and when the violence
of the shock was over, the
crater lay at his feet a salt
lagoon, and over all the
fruitful plain the sea lay
deep and still.</p>

<p class='c008'>He alone was left of all
that land’s inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c008'>To a nature like his
there was nothing terrible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>in solitude, nor did the
whole of this awful event
seem to him so sad as it
would have been to hear
one evil word from the lips
of a child.</p>

<p class='c008'>He lived for some years
after this a life of meditation
and peace, finding just
enough food to supply his
need among the fruits of
the higher mountain forests;
and one day, in his extreme
old age, a ship’s boat seeking
water entered the Lagoon.
He was taken on
board, and he brought with
him a manuscript which he
had written on slips of the
bark of trees, relating the
history of the Island. From
his own lips yet more of the
story was gathered and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>written down by a Jesuit
father who was returning
in the ship from a mission
to the newly-settled Antarctic
Continent.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is no more to be
told. The old Prince died
on the voyage, glad to depart
as soon as he had told
his tale.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had come to see
many things clearly in his
lonely years on the mountain
height. What these
things were, beyond what
has been written here, he
told to the Jesuit father—under
the seal of confession.</p>

How little any thought
in those happy days
from what quarter the
storm of invasion
would come, or how the whole
order of the civilized world
would be once more sunk under
waves of barbarism! We might
now indeed despair, only that as
from each such wave in ages
past a better world has risen
than that which went before,
from the depth of our trouble
now may rise the best of all-the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
